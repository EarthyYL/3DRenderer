To do (10/6):
Add different culling option for non-enclosed objects
Make it so that you rotate around the object instead of feeling like the object rotates on a point 
(comes from mixing world-view lighting vector and camera-view face normal vectors)
Find a way to deal with objects that have multiple layers below the camera (better culling again)
Try to improve performance when handling objects with many many vertices
Add free-fly control scheme
Transparent view?
Clean up functions, organizational overhaul (1/2 done)
Experiment with spherical coordinates and/or quaternion rotation  (not working so far, finding other stuff works fine though)
Consider adding different file types
Add option to change values after program is running by opening settings GUI
