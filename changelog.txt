To do (12/21):
1. Add free-fly control scheme
2. Add feat to change values after program is running by opening settings GUI
3. Auto orbit
Transparent view? (probably too slow)
Clean up functions, organizational overhaul (1/2 done)
Consider adding different file types
Add option to change values after program is running by opening settings GUI
See about using something like CuPy or OpenGL to offload more ops to GPU

Performance tracking:
In 50k face scene
50ms/frame overall
~11ms/frame on Project/Sort/Normals
~34ms/frame on draw calls
Others negligible


Changelog 
10/4:
Fixed camera getting stuck with mesh on
10/5:
Fixed gimbal lock, fixed object orientation
10/6:
Added simple culling algorithm
Added primitive lighting
Cleaned up code, updated GUI
10/8:
Even more refactoring, experimented with coordinate system and movement control
Locked axes to camera look-at point
Added camera rotation with A/D in the pan/rotate movement system
Set framework to add free fly control scheme
10/12:
Implemented painter's algorithm for proper rendering of more complex structures
Began the process of optimizing rendering processes
10/13:
HUGE optimization with rendering meshes
Vectorized the bulk of the indexing, culling, and lighting operations
Per-frame time decreased by a factor of 10
10/20:
Fixed lighting not rendering fully unlit polygons
12/20:
Switching off pygame polygon draw to manual rasterization
12/21:
Manual rasterization is incredibly slow, reverted changes
Tripled FPS by removing uncesssary Python indexing calls within draw loop
