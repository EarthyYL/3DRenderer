Personal project - simple 3D renderer in Python for .obj files
Made with numPy for array math, pyGame for basic drawing onscreen, and tkinter for GUI
To do (10/6):
Add different culling option for non-enclosed objects
Add basic lighting (calculate from normals?)
Try to improve performance when handling objects with many many vertices
Transparent view?
Consider adding different file types
